`printf (3)`


## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the `printf` function in the C programming language. The goal of this project is to replicate the functionality of the standard `printf` function with added features.

## Features

- Support for the following conversion specifiers: `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%p`.

- Support for flags `#`, `0`, `-`, `+` and ` `.

- Support for field width and precision.

- Support for the `*` flag for field width and precision.

- Support for the `l` and `ll` length modifiers.

- Support for non-existing flags or conversion specifiers.

## Usage

To use this implementation of the `printf` function, include the `my_printf.h` header file and use the `my_printf` function in place of the standard `printf` function.
